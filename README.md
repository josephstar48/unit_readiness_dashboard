# 🪂 Airborne Soldier Readiness & Risk Prediction Dashboard (ASR²D)
A data-driven platform to assess individual and unit readiness, predict soldier risk, and improve leader decision-making.

#### This project uses a synthetic but realistic dataset containing 10,000 objects
**Author:** Jose R. Estrella Sr.
**Program:** Galvanize Data Science & Analytics Bootcamp (DDI)
**Project Type:** To explore and model how physical performance, operational tempo, airborne exposure, leadership climate, and family/financial stressors influence burnout, injury risk, and overall unit/soldier readiness.

### Core goals:
1. Test whether Soldiers experiencing a high OPTEMPO trend have higher stress than those with improving (well-managed and sustainable) OPTEMPO.
2. Build a logistic regression model to predict high_burnout_risk.
3. Build a logistic regression model to predict ucmj.
4. Build a logistic regression model to predict poor_performance.
5. Build a logistic regression model to predict high_risk_of_injury.
6. Build a logistic regression model to predict suicide_risk.
7. Build a logistic regression model to predict medical_profile_status.
8. Build a logistic regression model to predict non_deployable.
9. Build a logistic regression model to predict retention_rate.
10. Build a logistic regression model to predict profile_status.
11. Build a linear, logistic, randomforest, and XGBRegressor models to predict soldier_readiness.
12. Build a linear, logistic, randomforest, and XGBRegressor models to predict retention_rate.
13. Deliver an interactive Streamlit dashboard (ASR²D) for leaders to explore readiness and risk.

- **Hypothesis test:**Do Soldiers with a high OPTEMPO trend have higher average stress scores than those with an improving (well-managed and sustainable) OPTEMPO trend?

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**Mean stress_score is equal for Soldiers with well-managed and high OPTEMPO trend.
**Alternate Hypothesis (H₁):**Mean stress_score is higher for Soldiers with a high OPTEMPO trend

### Hypothesis test interpretation 
**Statistical Conclusion:**
At α = 0.05:
- If p_one_sided < 0.05 → significant evidence that
Soldiers with declining OPTEMPO trends have higher stress scores.
- If p_one_sided ≥ 0.05 → no significant difference detected.
**Operational Meaning for Military Leaders**
If significant, the conclusion means:
1. When OPTEMPO is trending high (e.g., more missions, more structure, increasing workloads), Soldier stress increases.
2. Leaders should monitor units with declining OPTEMPO for:
- Elevated stress
- Burnout
- Readiness degradation
- Increased risk factors (injury, counseling issues, etc.)

- **Regression:**can we predict high_burnout_risk, ucmj, poor_performance, and soldier_readiness from operational, physical, and psychosocial indicators?

### Overview

This project explores how psychological and demographic factors influence drug consumption patterns using the UCI Drug Consumption Dataset (Kaggle). The analysis investigates relationships between personality traits, impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and the likelihood of using specific substances.

I performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to identify behavioral patterns that may predict substance use frequency. The analysis combines psychological measures (such as impulsivity and sensation-seeking) with demographic data to understand the link between personality and substance use.

### Research Questions
1. Do personality traits and demographics predict the likelihood and frequency of drug consumption?
2. Are impulsive or sensation-seeking individuals more likely to use psychoactive substances (e.g., cannabis, cocaine, LSD)?
3. How do demographics such as age, gender, and education level influence drug usage patterns?
4. Can we identify clusters of users based on drug type (e.g., stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens)?
5. Is there a relationship between personality factors and the type of substances consumed?

### Hypothesis
Personality traits (such as Neuroticism, Impulsivity, and Sensation Seeking) and demographic factors (age, gender, education) significantly influence the likelihood and frequency of drug consumption.

### Why Analysis Of This Topic Matters?
#### Understanding the behavioral and psychological factors behind substance use can:
- Help inform public health and education strategies.
- Identify risk profiles for early intervention.
- Demonstrate how data analytics can uncover behavioral insights from psychological and demographic variables.


### Data Source
**Dataset:** [Drug Consumption (UCI) — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/obeykhadija/drug-consumptions-uci)  
**Records/Rows:** 1,885 participants
**Columns/Features:** 32 attributes, including personality traits, demographics, and drug-use frequency across 18 substances.

### Key Attibutes/Columns:
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Education, Country, Ethnicity
- **Personality:** Neuroticism (Nscore), Extraversion (Escore), Openness (Oscore), Agreeableness (Ascore), Conscientiousness (Cscore), Impulsivity (Impulsive), Sensation-Seeking (SS)
- **Drug Usage:** 19 different drugs to include: Alcohol, Cannabis, Cocaine, Heroin, LSD, etc.
- **Consumption Levels:** CL0(0) through CL6(6) (from Never Used to Used in Last Day)
- **Control Variable:** Semer column (fictitious drug)

### Data Cleaning and Transformation Steps
1. **Load Data:** Read CSV file and preview structure.
2. **Standardize Columns:** Renamed columns and implemented uniformity with lowe case headers and underscore as needed.
3. **Handle Missing Values:** N/A, all values are present in dataset.
4. **Categorical Drug Levels/Scales:** Converted categorical usage (CL0–CL6) to numeric scores (0–6).
5. **Feature Engineering:** Created a drug_intensity_position column representing total consumption across substances, heavy_user and usage_frequency columns to display/flag frequent daily and weekly drug users "heavy users", and a usage_frequency_label column for better readability of data and graphs.
6. **Data Validation:** Checked for duplicates, outliers, and consistent value ranges.
7. **Normalize Personality Scores:** Used for comparison (using Min-Max scaling or Z-scores).
8. **Verify Data Balance:** Verified for all demographics and personality traits.

### Visualization Steps
For this project, I used visualizations to explore patterns between personality traits, demographics, and drug use.

**Here are the main visualization steps I followed:**

1. Demographics:
- Plotted age, gender, and education distributions to understand who was in the dataset.

2. Personality vs. Drug Use:
- Used heatmaps to see how traits like impulsivity and sensation-seeking relate to total drug use.

3. Specific Drug Patterns:
- Created barplots to explore how impulsivity affects use of different types pf drugs to include: cannabis, cocaine, and LSD.

4. Demographic Influence:
- Used boxplots to compare drug use intensity across age, gender, and education levels.

5. Clustering & Relationships:
- Built pairplots to find patterns between different drug types and user groups.

6. Summary:
- Created a bar chart of the top 5 most commonly used substances for quick insight.

These steps helped me visualize key relationships and understand how personality and demographics influence drug use.

### Key Insights 
- Impulsive and sensation-seeking personality traits strongly predict drug use. 
- Neuroticism correlates with depressant and stimulant drug consumption.  
- Higher education and age relate to lower overall drug frequency.
- Higher Impulsivity and Sensation Seeking scores correlate strongly with different types of drugs (stimulants, depressants, and hallucinogens).
- Neuroticism shows higher averages among depressant users (benzodiazepines).
- Older and more educated participants report lower frequency of illicit drug use.
- Openness personality trait also correlates correlate strongly with different types of drugs (stimulants, depressants, and hallucinogens).

### Recommendations
